# XEB+ neutrino Launcher Plugin

This is a plugin for the Xtreme Elite Boot Plus dashboard for the PlayStation 2.  
It allows XEB+ to load PlayStation 2 games from HDD, HDL, iLink, MMCE, MX4SIO, UDPBD, UDPFS, and USB via [neutrino](https://github.com/rickgaiser/neutrino).  

This fork includes a sync app `UDPBDG.exe` for windows or `UDPBD-for-XEB+-CLI.dll` for Linux.  
It automates the setup process when using UDPBD or UDPFS.  

**Please Note** When updating versions it is **Required** to update BOTH the XEBPLUS plugin, and the sync app.  
It is NOT recommended to mismatch different versions of the XEBPLUS plugin and the sync app.

## Setup

**Please Note** When updating versions it is **Required** to update BOTH the XEBPLUS plugin, and the sync app.  
It is NOT recommended to mismatch different versions of the XEBPLUS plugin and the sync app.  

*Note: This setup process is for version 2.11 of this plugin.  
If you are updating from version 2.9 or earlier, you may need to remove the `XEBPLUS/CFG/neutrinoLauncher` folder on your USB drive.  
If you are updating from version 1.x, you will need to remove the old version of neutrino Launcher from your XEB+ install before continuing.  
This includes all neutrino Launcher files in the `APPS`, `PLG`, and `CFG` folders, as well as the `CD` and `DVD` folders on the root of your USB drive.*

1. If you have not already done so, download the Xtreme Elite Boot Plus Xmas 2021 showcase.  
[Archive.org Mirror (recommended)](https://web.archive.org/web/*/hwc.nat.cu/ps2-vault/hwc-projects/xebplus)  
or  
[Howling Wolf & Chelsea's PS2-Vault](http://www.hwc.nat.cu/ps2-vault/hwc-projects/xebplus/)  
2. Use [7-zip](https://7-zip.org/) to extract the RAR file. (Windows does not natively support `.rar` with passwords.)  
The password is at the bottom of `xebplus_xmas_showcase.rar\Distribution License.txt`.  
Extract the RAR then copy the `XEBPLUS` folder to the root of your MBR FAT32 or MBR exFAT USB drive, and ensure that you can load into the XEB+ dashboard on your PlayStation 2.  
Note that if you are using an MBR exFAT formatted USB drive, you will need to use PS2BBL and [this version](https://github.com/israpps/wLaunchELF_ISR) of wLaunchELF.  
3. (optional) Configure your PS2 exploit of choice to autostart XEB+.  
4. Download the latest version of this plugin from the [latest release on this page](https://github.com/MegaBitmap/UDPBD-for-XEBP/releases).  
Extract the `XEBPLUS` folder to the root of your USB drive, merging all folders if prompted.  
5. Extract the UDPBDG app or List Builder script to somewhere in `Documents` or `Downloads` (It is a portable app, do NOT use `Program Files` or any other system related folder).  
6. Complete setup by following the steps specific to the device you want to load games from.  


### UDPBD/UDPFS on Windows

**If you plan to use virtual memory cards please read this:**  
VMCs only work with exFAT partitions.  
You must use udpbd-server or udpfs_bd when using VMCs, udpbd-vexfat and udpfs do NOT support VMCs.  
After opening neutrino Launcher in XEBP with a game in view, press the ⏹ square button to open the context menu.  
In the context menu you can enable or disable VMCs globally or individually per game.  
For transferring, importing, or exporting saves from VMC files you can use [PS2-VMC-GUI](https://github.com/MegaBitmap/PS2-VMC-GUI).  

7. From the [latest release on this page](https://github.com/MegaBitmap/UDPBD-for-XEBP/releases), download then extract the `UDPBDG` folder somewhere in `Documents` or `Downloads` (It is a portable app, do NOT use `Program Files` or any other system related folder).  

8. Start the UDPBDG sync/server app and pick a mode.  
udpfs is the recommended.  

9. Rip/copy any PlayStation 2 ISOs you wish to load into the folder (CD or DVD) that corresponds with their original source media.

10. Click on choose game path and pick any game in a CD or DVD folder.  
Example:  `E:/DVD/Grand Theft Auto III.iso`  
or        `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Documents\PS2\DVD\TimeSplitters 2.iso`  

11. **Direct Connection** - Plug in the ethernet cable as shown: ↓  
![ps2-slim-connected-to-laptop](readme-images/ps2-slim-connected-to-laptop.jpg)  
**Router Connection** - Plug in the ethernet cables as shown: ↓  
![ps2-slim-connected-to-router-and-laptop](readme-images/ps2-slim-connected-to-router-and-laptop.jpg)  

12. For a direct connection, as seen in the previous step, set a manual IPv4 address and subnet mask.  
![pc-ip-settings](readme-images/pc-ip-settings.jpg)  
For using a router instead of a direct connection, set the PC's IP assignment to *Automatic (DHCP)*.  
On the PC go into network connections or run `ncpa.cpl`.  
Right click the Ethernet adapter and select properties, then select IPv4 properties.  
Enable "Obtain an IP address automatically".  
Then [follow this guide](http://ps2ulaunchelf.pbworks.com/w/page/19520139/ps2ftp) for assigning a proper IP address on the PS2.  
The ps2 IP address settings for launchELF need to be changed.  
For the first IP address, the first three parts must match the default gateway of the router or switch.  
For example: 192.168.1.?  
The last part (?) needs to be a unique number between 2 and 254, example: `192.168.1.147`  
Set the middle number, subnet mask, to `255.255.255.0`  
The third IP address or default gateway, must match the default gateway of the router or switch.  
Most likely it will be `192.168.0.1` or `192.168.1.1`  

13. Hold *R1* on the controller during FreeMCBoot/PS2BBL startup to open LaunchELF.  
Open MISC -> PS2Net  
![launchelf-ps2net](readme-images/launchelf-ps2net.jpg)  

14. Let the PS2 idle on this screen for the next steps on the PC.  
![launchelf-ftp-enabled](readme-images/launchelf-ftp-enabled.jpg)

15. Choose the game path and click Sync to SNL.  
![mainWindow](readme-images/udpbdg-settings.jpg)  

16. Type in the IP address and connect to launchELF's PS2Net.  
Click `Sync`, upon success this message will be displayed:  
![udpbd-xeb-synced](readme-images/udpbdg-sync.jpg)

17. Click `Start Server` and make sure to allow.  
![udpbdg-firewall](readme-images/udpbdg-firewall.jpg)  
This will start the UDPBDG notification tray icon that runs the server.  
If you mistakenly clicked cancel on the firewall prompt, close UDPBDG by clicking Exit on the tray icon.  
Then either move the UDPBDG folder inside a new folder or manually delete the inbound rules for UDPBDG in 'Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security' to make the prompt reappear.  

Click the tray icon to show/hide console output, open the settings/sync window, or shutdown the server.  
The server needs to be open and running for the entire play session (Disable sleep on the PC).  

18. The PC setup is now complete, back on the PS2 run XEB+.  
![launchelf-xeb](readme-images/launchelf-xeb.jpg)

19. Play!  
![xeb-game-list](readme-images/xeb-game-list.jpg)  

Repeat steps 13-19 of the setup process after adding, renaming, or removing games.  

If you want the server to start automatically when the PC is turned on follow these steps:

- Right Click `UDPBDG.exe` → Show more → Create Shortcut
- Move the UDPBDG shortcut to this folder:  
`C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`  
Now the server will start automatically.  


### UDPBD/UDPFS on Linux

This guide uses *APT* with Ubuntu, if you are using a different distribution these steps may vary.  

7. Compile the udpbd-server
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install git build-essential
git clone https://gitlab.com/ps2max/udpbd-server.git
cd udpbd-server
make
```
8. Install .NET 10, GParted, and exfatprogs
```
sudo apt install dotnet-runtime-10.0 gparted exfatprogs
```
9. Create a new exFAT partition in GParted and note the partition number.  
For this guide the exFAT partition is `/dev/nvme0n1p6`, it will most likely be slightly different on your system.  
![gparted-exfat](readme-images/gparted-exfat.jpg)
10. Mount it to `/mnt/ps2`. Your storage device `/dev/nvme0n1p6` will probably be different.
```
sudo mkdir /mnt/ps2/
sudo mount /dev/nvme0n1p6 /mnt/ps2/ -o uid=$USER
```
11. Create folders named `CD` and `DVD` in the exFAT partition.  
Rip/copy any PlayStation 2 disc images you wish to load into the folder that corresponds with their original source media.  
Example:  `/mnt/ps2/DVD/Grand Theft Auto III.iso`

12. From the [latest release on this page](https://github.com/MegaBitmap/UDPBD-for-XEBP/releases), extract the `UDPBD-XEB-CLI` folder.  

13. **Direct Connection** - Plug in the ethernet cable as shown: ↓  
![ps2-slim-connected-to-laptop](readme-images/ps2-slim-connected-to-laptop.jpg)  
**Router Connection** - Plug in the ethernet cables as shown: ↓  
![ps2-slim-connected-to-router-and-laptop](readme-images/ps2-slim-connected-to-router-and-laptop.jpg)  

14. For a direct connection, as seen in the previous step, set a manual IPv4 address and subnet mask.  
![ubuntu-ip-settings](readme-images/ubuntu-ip-settings.jpg)  
For using a router instead of a direct connection, set the PC's IP assignment to *Automatic (DHCP)*.  
Then [follow this guide](http://ps2ulaunchelf.pbworks.com/w/page/19520139/ps2ftp) for assigning a proper IP address on the PS2.  
The ps2 IP address settings for launchELF need to be changed.  
For the first IP address, the first three parts must match the default gateway of the router or switch.  
For example: 192.168.1.?  
The last part (?) needs to be a unique number between 2 and 254, example: `192.168.1.147`  
Set the middle number, subnet mask, to `255.255.255.0`  
The third IP address or default gateway, must match the default gateway of the router or switch.  
Most likely it will be `192.168.0.1` or `192.168.1.1`  

15. Hold *R1* on the controller during FreeMCBoot/PS2BBL startup to open LaunchELF.  
Open MISC -> PS2Net  
![launchelf-ps2net](readme-images/launchelf-ps2net.jpg)  

16. Let the PS2 idle on this screen for the next steps on the PC.  
![launchelf-ftp-enabled](readme-images/launchelf-ftp-enabled.jpg)

17. Run the sync app, please note that these are example parameters.
```
dotnet UDPBD-for-XEB+-CLI.dll -path /mnt/ps2 -ps2ip 192.168.0.10 -bin2iso
```
Here is a list of all parameters:  
`-path ?` is the file path to the CD and DVD folder that contain game ISOs.  
`-ps2ip ?` is the ip address for connecting to the PS2 with PS2Net.  
`-downloadart` enables automatic game artwork downloading.  
`-bin2iso` enables automatic CD-ROM Bin to ISO conversion.  
`-enablevmc` will assign a virtual memory card for each game or group of games in 'vmc_groups.list'.  
`-udpfs` will enable udpfs_server file-system support by updating 'loadUDPBD.lua'.  
`-udpfs_bd` will enable udpfs_server block-device support by updating 'config/bsd-udpbd.toml'.  

18. Unmount the exFAT partition then Start the udpbd-server.
```
sudo umount /mnt/ps2
sudo ./udpbd-server /dev/nvme0n1p6
```
The server needs to be open and running for the entire play session.

19. (optional) For automatic XEB+ startup:  
 - The files in PS2BBL-AutoStart will set PS2BBL to automatically run XEB+.  
 - To install copy these files onto a memory card with PS2BBL installed.  
 Depending on which version the config can be found in mc?:/SYS-CONF/ or mc?:/PS2BBL/  
 - See [this](PS2BBL-AutoStart/README.txt) for more info.  

20. Launch XEB+ then Play!

To add, rename, or remove games stop the server then mount the exFAT storage device to `/mnt/ps2`  
```
sudo mount /dev/nvme0n1p6 /mnt/ps2/ -o uid=$USER
```
Make the changes and repeat steps 15-20 of the Linux setup process.

Repeat steps 9-13 to add or remove games on the USB drive.

### Adding Artwork

The neutrino Launcher plugin can display game-specific artwork in the selection menu.  
This feature uses the same file type and naming conventions as Open PS2 Loader, which allows the plugin to take advantage of existing PS2 artwork libraries designed for OPL.  
The UDPBD Sync app will automatically install artwork if you check the box `Download Artwork` before clicking sync.  
This will download artwork from the [OPLM art backup on archive.org](https://oplmanager.com/site/?backups).

 For manual artwork installation, the following additional steps are required:

1. Prepare or acquire artwork files with the same file format and naming conventions as those used by OPL.
    * Only background art (*_BG*) and disc icon (*_ICO*) files are used by this plugin.
    * Some recent versions of OPL have added support for 128x128 disc icons.  
	While these are technically supported, it is recommended to only use the older 64x64 icons.  
2. Copy the artwork files you wish to use to `/ART` or `/XEBPLUS/GME/ART` on your USB drive.
    * If it exists, the `ART` directory on the USB root will always take priority over `/XEBPLUS/GME/ART`.
3. Launch XEB+ and select one of the neutrino Launcher plugins.  
    * If the plugin detects files in one of the artwork directories, it will automatically create an artwork cache in the `CFG/neutrinoLauncher` folder.
    * This is necessary to maintain a usable level of performance while displaying artwork in the menu.

The caching process can take a long time to complete the first time it runs, potentially over an hour if you have a very large game library.  

Making any changes to any of the *.list* files in the `CFG/neutrinoLauncher` folder, or modifying the cache folder will trigger a refresh of the artwork cache the next time the plugin is launched.  
A refresh can also be triggered manually from the plugin settings.  
Cache refreshes take much less time than initial creation, so long as the cache folder has not been moved or deleted.


### Adding Cheats

The neutrino Launcher can be set to load [Cheat Device](https://israpps.github.io/CheatDevicePS2/) prior to starting a game.  
This allows for the use of Action Replay / Gameshark style cheat codes.  
To make use of this feature, the following additional steps are required. 

1. Create or acquire cheat database (*.cht*) files in Cheat Device format.
    * Database files should only contain cheats for a single game.
    * Database files must be named by PlayStation 2 title ID using this format: `SLUS_123.45.cht`
2. Create a directory called `CHT` on the root of the USB drive containing your XEB+ install.
3. Copy your *.cht* files to the `CHT` directory.

A collection widescreen patch codes in the correct format can be found [here](https://github.com/sync-on-luma/PS2-widescreen-cheats).  
Other cheat codes will need to be converted from other collections or added by hand.


## Troubleshooting 

Here are some common issues that can easily be resolved:

### Game File Integrity Validation

If there is a particular game that is not working right, the first thing to do is check the file hash.  
The easiest way to do so is to use [an online hashing tool](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/md5_checksum.html)  

After selecting a file, copy the MD5 hash and paste it into the *Quick search* at http://redump.org  
If you are redirected to the game page then the selected game file is verified good.  
If the search results in *No discs found.* then the game file is most likely corrupted.  
Please note that CD-ROM based games converted to ISO will not be found in the redump database.  

### Manually Reset Plugin Configuration

If the neutrino Launcher plugin freezes or becomes unresponsive, you may need to manually erase the configuration files.  
To do so, first open LaunchELF.  
Then navigate to `mass:/XEBPLUS/CFG/` and highlight the `neutrinoLauncher/` folder.  
Hit *R1* on the controller then choose *Delete*.  
This will completely reset the neutrino Launcher plugin's settings to default.  
After doing so, you will need to re-sync the game list.  

### Network Testing

When using UDPBD it is very important that the network connection is fast and stable.  
The easiest way to test this is by using the `ping` command.  
On the PS2 open LaunchELF then PS2Net, this will initialize the network so that the PS2 will receive the pings.  
On the PC run the following command, please note that the IP address for the PS2 may be different.  
```
cmd /K ping 192.168.0.10 -n 50 -l 512
```
This will send 50 pings to the PS2, after about a minute it will finish.  
The statistics will tell you basic information about the network performance.  
There should be 0 lost packets (0% loss).  
The maximum approximate round trip time should be 3ms or less.  
If your network does not meet these performance metrics then problems may occur.

### Plugin reports "Error: Could not read \<file\>.list. The file may be missing or corrupted"
This error occurs when the game list file for the selected drive type is missing or severely malformed.  
Refer to the setup procedure for your drive type to (re)build the game list.

### PS2 reboots instead of starting a game
This behavior occurs when the *.iso* file for the selected game cannot be found.  
The console may hang on a black screen for up to 30 seconds before rebooting.  
Some things to check if you encounter this issue:  
* Ensure your game drive is properly connected to the console.  
MX4SIO adapters must be in Memory Card Slot 2, and MMCE devices in Memory Card Slot 1.  
Neither device type will work if connected through a multitap.  
* Ensure the game you are trying to load is present on your game drive.  
* Ensure your game drive is formatted as exFAT. If using a hard drive, you must use an MBR partition table.
* Ensure the plugin is trying to load the correct file.  
This can be accomplished by rebuilding the game list.  
* If using UDPBD, ensure the server software is running and that both the PS2 and server are connected to the same network and properly configured.

### PS2 freezes on a black screen when starting a single game
This behavior usually occurs when data for the selected game cannot be read.
Some things to try if you encounter this issue:
* Launch the game again with different compatibility settings.  
A list of known working configurations can be found [here](https://github.com/sync-on-luma/xebplus-neutrino-loader-plugin/wiki/Compatibility-List).  

### PS2 freezes on a black screen when starting any game
* Verify the integrity of the USB drive with CHKDSK or similar application.
* Re-copy the neutrino Launcher plugin files to the USB drive. Ensure the drive is properly ejected from the computer after doing this.
* Reformat the USB drive, then reinstall XEB+ and the neutrino Launcher plugin.
* If all else fails, shred the partition on the USB drive and create a new one. Then reinstall XEB+ and the neutrino Launcher plugin.

### XEB+ crashes when loading the plugin
This is usually caused by a stale artwork cache.  
If this is the case, manually triggering a cache refresh from neutrino Launcher Settings will fix the issue.  
If that does not work, the following my help:  
* Delete the `menu.cfg` file found in `XEBPLUS/CFG/neutrinoLauncher` on your USB drive.  
* Disable disc and/or background artwork in the neutrino Launcher Settings.  
* Delete the `XEBPLUS/CFG/neutrinoLauncher`folder from your USB drive. Note that you will have to rebuild all game lists and re-cache artwork if you do this.

### Plugin crashes when scrolling the list
This happens when the plugin attempts to load a corrupted art asset.  
Disabling disc and/or background artwork in the neutrino Launcher Settings can be used to diagnose and temporarily resolve the issue.  
For a permanent fix, the offending artwork file must be removed or replaced.

### Basic Usage

Launch the XEB+ dashboard on your PlayStation 2 console, and select the appropriate *neutrino Launcher* entry from the menu.  
Wait a moment for the plugin to load. If there are artwork files present, you may need to wait for the artwork cache to build or refresh.  
Select a game from the list to launch it with neutrino, or press back to close the plugin.  
Repeat steps 9-14 of the setup process for your drive type each time you wish to add or remove games.

### Game Options

Press ⏹ SQUARE while in the game selection menu, and the context menu will open.  
Context menu options apply to the currently highlighted game by default, and are as follows:

  * **Add To Favorites** - Adds the current game to the favorites list. If the current game is already in the favorites list, this option will remove it.
  * **Global / Per-Game Settings** - This option toggles between Global and Per-Game settings modes.  
When set to Global Settings, options shown below this one will apply to all games.  
When set to Per-Game Settings, options shown below this one will apply only to the current game.
  * **Enable Cheat Device** - When enabled, Cheat Device will be injected into the game load sequence.  
  To start the selected game from within Cheat Device, press START, select *Start Game*, and choose the first option below *==Disc==*.
  * **Enable VMC** - When enabled, the selected game will save data to a virtual memory card image instead of the memory card in Slot 1 of the PS2.
  *  **Use Unique VMC** - If the selected game is in a memory card group, enabling this option will force it to use a dedicated VMC instead of the default group one. This applies to both internal VMCs and those created by smart memory cards.
    More info on memory card groups can be found [here](https://github.com/sync-on-luma/xebplus-neutrino-loader-plugin/wiki/Memory-Card-Groups).
  * **Enable Boot Logo** - When enabled, the PlayStation 2 logo will be shown on screen when starting a game. This setting can affect compatibility, particularly for games that do not match your console's region.
  * **Fast Reads** - When enabled, the data transfer rate for games will be able to exceed that of the PlayStation 2 DVD drive.  
  This will reduce load times if using UDPBD or a hard drive, but can cause compatibility issues with some titles.  
  * **Synchronous Reads** - When enabled, asynchronous (background) loading will not be used. This can affect load times, and fixes compatibility issues with some titles.
  * **Unhook Syscalls** - When enabled, neutrino Syscalls will be removed from memory after starting a game. This fixes compatibility issues with some titles.
  * **Emulate DVD-DL** - When enabled, neutrino will emulate the data structure of a dual-layer DVD. This option is required for DVD9 images that have been modified to fit a DVD5.
  * **Fix Buffer Overrun** - Fixes a compatibility issue present in a very small number of games.
  * **GSM Video Mode** - Force the Graphics Synthesizer to use a specific field scanning mode.  
    * Default - Use the game's default video mode.  
    * Progressive - Use the progressive scan equivalent of the game's default video mode. This is 480p for NTSC titles and 576p for PAL.  
    * 1080ix1 : force 1080i width x1, height x1 (very small!)  
    * 1080ix2 : force 1080i width x2, height x2  
    * 1080ix3 : force 1080i width x3, height x3  
  * **GSM Compatibility Mode** - Select between three different field-flipping types.  
  Changing this can affect the compatibility of other GSM settings.  
  * **Refresh Artwork** - Immediately delete and re-copy cached artwork for the current game. This option is not affected by the current settings mode.

Closing the context menu will automatically save the currently selected options.  
Refer to the [compatibility list](https://github.com/sync-on-luma/xebplus-neutrino-loader-plugin/wiki/Compatibility-List) to find known-working configurations for specific games.

### Recent Games

The neutrino Launcher plugin keeps track of the ten most recently played games for each drive type. Recent games are stored in the recent games list in reverse chronological order.  

To access the recent games list, press 🔼 TRIANGLE while on the game selection menu. Press 🔼 TRIANGLE again to advance to the favorites list. 

### Favorites

Games can be added to a favorites list for easy organization and quicker access.  

The favorites list is shared between all four drive types, however only titles present on the currently selected drive will be displayed.  

To add a game to the favorites list, open the context menu and select "Add To Favorites", as described in the previous section. Repeat this process to remove a game from the favorites list.  
When a game is in the favorites list, it's title will be flanked by "●" on either side.  

To access the favorites list, press 🔼 TRIANGLE while on the recent games list. Press 🔼 TRIANGLE again to show all games.  
The plugin will always start up to the all games list, even if it was previously closed while viewing the favorites list.

### Neutrino Launcher Settings

This package includes a secondary plugin called *neutrino Launcher Settings*, which is accessible from the far right column of the XEB+ dashboard.  
This contains a settings menu whose options apply to the main neutrino Launcher plugins. The available options are as follows:
   
  * **Enable HDD** - When enabled, *neutrino Launcher (HDD)* will be available on the XEB+ dashboard.
  * **Enable MX4SIO** - When enabled, *neutrino Launcher (MX4SIO)* will be available on the XEB+ dashboard.
  * **Enable MMCE** - When enabled, *neutrino Launcher (MMCE)* will be available on the XEB+ dashboard.
  * **Enable USB** - When enabled, *neutrino Launcher (USB)* will be available on the XEB+ dashboard.
  * **Enable UDPBD** - When enabled, *neutrino Launcher (UDPBD)* will be available on the XEB+ dashboard.
  * **Enable iLINK** - When enabled, *neutrino Launcher (iLink)* will be available on the XEB+ dashboard.
  * **Enable HDL** - When enabled, *neutrino Launcher (HDL)* will be available on the XEB+ dashboard.
  * **Disable Disc Art** - When enabled, game specific disc icons will not be shown on the menu. This can decrease lag when browsing the list.
  * **Disable Background Art** - When enabled, game specific backgrounds will not be shown on the menu. This can improve performance when browsing the list.
  * **Disable Status Messages** - When enabled, the text that appears at the bottom of the screen to indicate loading and other behavior will not be shown.
  * **Disable Background Fading** - When enabled, background artwork will not fade in/out when the image changes.
  * **Disable Icon Animation** - When enabled, the disc icon for the currently highlighted game will not spin.
  *  **Show Title ID** - When enabled, each game's PlayStation 2 title ID will be shown under its title.
  *  **Show Media** - When enabled, each game's media type will be shown under it's title.
  * **Refresh Artwork Cache** - Sets artwork cache to refresh next time one of the neutrino Launcher plugins is loaded.
  * **Clean Artwork Cache** - Immediately scan the artwork cache for unused files and remove them.

Returning to the dashboard will automatically save the currently selected options.  
An XEB+ reboot/refresh is required for changes made to this setting to take effect.  


## Integrating With Custom Themes

The six neutrino Launcher plugins and the settings plugin each use their own custom dashboard icon that is not normally present in XEB+.  
Versions of these icons that are visually consistent with the default XEB+ theme are included and will be loaded by default.  
Alternate icons will be used instead if icon files with the correct names are present in the current XEB+ theme folder.  

The filenames each plugin looks for are as follows:

  * *ic_tool_neutrino_hdl.png* - neutrino Launcher (HDD)
  * *ic_tool_neutrino_mx4.png* - neutrino Launcher (MX4SIO)
  * *ic_tool_neutrino_mmce.png* - neutrino Launcher (MMCE)
  * *ic_tool_neutrino_usb.png* - neutrino Launcher (USB)
  * *ic_tool_neutrino_udpbd.png* - neutrino Launcher (UDPBD)
  * *ic_tool_neutrino_ilink.png* - neutrino Launcher (iLink)
  * *ic_set_neutrino_cfg.png* - neutrino Launcher Settings

If you wish to reference the included versions of these icons, they are located at `XEBPLUS/APPS/neutrinoLauncher/image/`.


## Known Issues and Limitations

  * Artwork cannot be refreshed from the context menu while in the favorites list.
  * It is not currently possible to mount VMCs in Slot 2.
  * Repeatedly adding/removing a game from the favorites list may cause a crash.
  * The plugin may crash when switching to the favorites list for some users. The cause of this issue is currently unknown.
  * The plugin may need to be closed and re-opened for refreshed artwork to be shown.
  * If an artwork cache build / refresh is interrupted, the system may crash the next time the plugin is loaded.  
If this happens, the behavior will persist until the cache is refreshed manually.
  * The *neutrino Launcher* plugin can take up to 30 seconds to load, and may appear to hang if there are a large number of games present.
  * If enabled, the PlayStation 2 boot logo will display incorrectly for games that do not match the console's region.
  * If installed, the PlayStation 2 hard drive will spin up when loading games from MX4SIO or UDPBD.
  * Scrolling through the list quickly may cause corrupted graphics to be displayed briefly.
